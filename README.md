## Making basic contributions.
If you want to make simple changes, like adding a post or modifying an indivudal file, you can folow our fork and pull workflow to submit your change. To begin, you'll need a [github account](https://github.com/account) and [git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) installed on your computer. Once that's out of the way, you can submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). [We](https://github.com/orgs/the-jonx/teams/web) will review the request and take care of the rest. Some simple changes you can make using this workflow include:

* Adding new posts to the website. Creating new [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files in the `_posts` directory will result in new blog posts being added to The Jonx Blog.
