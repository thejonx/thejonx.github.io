Someone's gonna jonx. Might as well be you. Follow the directions below if you want to participate.

## Making basic contributions.
If you want to make simple changes, like adding a post or modifying an indivudal file, you can folow our fork and pull workflow to submit your change. To begin, you'll need a [github account](https://github.com/account) and [git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) installed on your computer. Once that's out of the way, you can submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). [We](https://github.com/orgs/the-jonx/teams/web) will review the request and take care of the rest. Some simple changes you can make using this workflow include:

* Adding new posts to the website. Creating new [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files in the `_posts` directory will result in new blog posts being added to The Jonx Blog.

## Making complicated contributions.
Changes beyond adding pages and simple changes are much easier to contribute if you have a working [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) environment. If you want to get started with an isolated, pre-made Jekyll environment, consider pulling a container from [Docker Hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/grahamc/jekyll) or an image from [Vagrant Cloud](https://vagrantcloud.com/marty/boxes/trusty64).  

If you have any trouble setting up a development environment or suspect a bug, please open an [issue](https://github.com/the-jonx/the-jonx.github.io/issues).
